MR Card Game is an educational, customizable AR (Augmented Reality) tower defense card game application that allows for playful learning by combining quiz questions with engaging real-time strategy gameplay. The goal of the game is to defend your castle against approaching attackers by casting spells, setting traps and building powerful defensive towers to slow down the invaders. In order gain access to these defenses, players need to answer questions from a chosen field or topic. If answered correctly, players can use varying cards to defeat wave after wave of a wide variety of attackers.

## Setup
### AR Image Targets
To play the MR Card Game, printing out the AR Image Targets is required. These are physical card that you can find [here](https://github.com/AnPerret/Evaluation-Repository/raw/main/Image%20Targets/ImageTargets.pdf). Simply download and print out the sheet in this .pdf-file and cut out the individual cards with scissors or a different cutting device.

### Quizzes
In order to play the MR Card Game, you will also need a pre-build quiz from which the questions are asked during the game. You can either create this quiz yourself using the MR Card Game Question Creator Tool which you can download [here](https://github.com/rwth-acis/MR-Question-Creator-For-Card-Game), or you can simply download a quiz created by someone else. [Here](https://github.com/JulianStaab/mr-card-game-quizzes/) you can find a repository of pre-build quizzes ready to use.

After creating or downloading a quiz, the quiz folder has to be placed on your device in the \Card\Android\data\com.RWTH-ACIS.MRCardGame\files\ folder. This is important otherwise the quiz won't show up in the app.

Each trap page holds the strength of the trap's slowdown effect as "Slow Effect", the size of the traps as *Size* and sometimes a special effect as *Special*. Each spell page holds different information depending on the type of spell. If applicable the different entries mean the following: The damage the spell card will apply onto enemies as *Damage*, the range of the spell's effect or damage as *Range*, the probability with which to draw the spell as *Number in deck*, the target of the spell's effect or damage as *Target*, the negative effects of the spell as *Malus*, the effects of the spell as *Effect*, the duration of the spell's effect or damage as *Duration* and sometimes a special effect as *Special*.
