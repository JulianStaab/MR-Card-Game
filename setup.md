## How to Setup the Game

### AR Image Targets
To play the MR Card Game, printing out the AR Image Targets is required. These are physical card that you can find here. Simply download and print out the sheet in this .pdf-file and cut out the individual cards with scissors or a different cutting device.

<div> <ul class="icons alt">
			<li><a href="https://github.com/rwth-acis/MR-Card-Game/raw/main/MR%20Card%20Game/Assets/ImageTargetsModified.pdf" class="button icon fa-download">Image Targets</a></li>
	  </ul>
</div>

### Quizzes
In order to play the MR Card Game, you will also need a pre-build quiz from which the questions are asked during the game. You can either create this quiz yourself using the MR Card Game Question Creator Tool which you can download [here](https://github.com/rwth-acis/MR-Question-Creator-For-Card-Game), or you can simply download a quiz created by someone else. Here you can find a repository of pre-build quizzes ready to use: 
<div> <ul class="icons alt">
			<li><a href="https://github.com/JulianStaab/mr-card-game-quizzes/" class="button alt icon fa-github">More Quizzes</a></li>
	  </ul>
</div>

After creating or downloading a quiz, the quiz folder has to be placed on your device in the following folder:
- **Android:** `\Card\Android\data\com.RWTH-ACIS.MRCardGame\files\` 
- **Windows:** `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\LocalLow\RWTH-ACIS\MR Card Game`

This is important otherwise the quiz won't show up in the app.
