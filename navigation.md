## Navigating the Main Menu
<div><a class="image main"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19326682/159561647-d021f722-c9f9-4a41-9a9c-fc74d451462a.PNG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a></div>

After starting the application, you will be placed in the main menu. There you have three options to select: `Play Levels`, `Download Levels` and `Gallery`. Clicking on the cross button above the three options and to the right of the title will close the application. This button, although named differently can be found on all menu pages as either back or menu button sending you one page back or back to the main menu page entirely.
### Play Levels

Clicking `Play Levels` is the standard way to start a game. The next page will show the folder structure of the application where you can select the quiz to use in the game. If everything was set-up properly, you should see the quiz that you downloaded and placed in this folder in the Setup section. If not, make sure all Quiz Setup steps are fulfilled. After selecting a quiz, you will see the quiz name and description and a start button in the form of a triangle. Press it to get to the start screen where you can press `Start` to go start the game.

### Download Levels

Clicking `Download Levels` allows users to play the game without creating their own quizzes. The next page will show the pre-built quizzes which can all be downloaded by clicking on them. Clicking one will immediately download it and if you select back at the top and `Play Levels` in the Main Menu, you will see it as a playable quiz.

### Gallery

Navigating the Gallery allows players to learn about all the different defenses they have available to them during the game. Each gallery page provides detailed information about all the kinds of towers, traps and spells. Each tower page holds the strength of its attack as *Attack*, the range of the attacks of the tower as *Range*, the frequency of its attacks as *Attackspeed* and sometimes a special effect as *Special*. Each trap page holds the strength of the trap's slowdown effect as *Slow Effect*, the size of the traps as *Size* and sometimes a special effect as *Special*. Each spell page holds different information depending on the type of spell. If applicable the different entries mean the following: The damage the spell card will apply onto enemies as *Damage*, the range of the spell's effect or damage as *Range*, the probability with which to draw the spell as *Number in deck*, the target of the spell's effect or damage as *Target*, the negative effects of the spell as *Malus*, the effects of the spell as *Effect*, the duration of the spell's effect or damage as *Duration* and sometimes a special effect as *Special*.
